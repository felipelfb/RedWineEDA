```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
# Load all of the packages that you end up using in your analysis in this code
# chunk.

# Notice that the parameter "echo" was set to FALSE for this code chunk. This
# prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output. You should set
# echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file, unless it makes sense for your
# report to show the code that generated a particular plot.

# The other parameters for "message" and "warning" should also be set to FALSE
# for other code chunks once you have verified that each plot comes out as you
# want it to. This will clean up the flow of your report.

> **Tip**: Before you create any plots, it is a good idea to provide a short
introduction into the dataset that you are planning to explore. Replace this
quoted text with that general information!

This dataset is one of the datasets created on the paper "Modeling wine 
preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties" [Cortez et al., 
2009]. The inputs include objective tests, such as PH values, and the output is 
based on sensory data, gathered from at least 3 wine expert evaluations. The 
output value ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). The wines are 
variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. This particular dataset contains 
information regarding the red wines.

There are 1599 different wines, 11 features and 1 output value (quality).
Information about the features and the output value is the following (provided 
by the original authors):

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

* 1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
* 2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
* 3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)
* 4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)
* 5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
* 6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
* 7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
* 8 - density (g / cm^3)
* 9 - pH
* 10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
* 11 - alcohol (% by volume)

Output variable (based on sensory data):

* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

Description of the features and output value is the following (also provided 
by the original authors):

* 1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile 
(do not evaporate readily)
* 2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high 
of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
* 3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' 
and flavor to wines
* 4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, 
it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater 
than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
* 5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
* 6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between 
molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial 
growth and the oxidation of wine
* 7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low 
concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 
concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
* 8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the 
percent alcohol and sugar content
* 9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very 
acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
* 10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas 
(S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
* 11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

# Univariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: In this section, you should perform some preliminary exploration of
your dataset. Run some summaries of the data and create univariate plots to
understand the structure of the individual variables in your dataset. Don't
forget to add a comment after each plot or closely-related group of plots!
There should be multiple code chunks and text sections; the first one below is
just to help you get started.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

str(redwine)

```


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}

summary(subset(redwine, select=-c(X)))

```

The dataset consists of 11 numerical features and 1 integer feature (quality). 
The X feature just represents the index of the observation on the data frame.

On the summary it is possible to identify some initial trends on the data. For 
example, there are some features that seem to have outliers on them, such as: 
volatile acidity, citric acid, redisual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, 
total sulfur dioxide, and sulphates.

Some visualization of the features can help to visualize that.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=quality)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=fixed.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=volatile.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=citric.acid)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=residual.sugar)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=chlorides)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=free.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=total.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=density)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=pH)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=sulphates)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=alcohol)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

These histograms help us visualize how some of the features on the dataset have 
outliers, given that some of them are right tailed. Chlorides is a good example 
of this characteristic. Most of the data is around 0.05 and 0.15, with very 
few examples of wine going up to 6.

Also, most of the data is relatively normal, with the exception of citric acid.

Let's transform some of the features using a log scale to try and get better 
visualizations of them. Let's try residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur 
dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and sulphates.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=residual.sugar)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()

```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=chlorides)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()

```

```{r}

ggplot(data=redwine, aes(x=free.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()

```



> **Tip**: Make sure that you leave a blank line between the start / end of
each code block and the end / start of your Markdown text so that it is
formatted nicely in the knitted text. Note as well that text on consecutive
lines is treated as a single space. Make sure you have a blank line between
your paragraphs so that they too are formatted for easy readability.

# Univariate Analysis

> **Tip**: Now that you've completed your univariate explorations, it's time to
reflect on and summarize what you've found. Use the questions below to help you
gather your observations and add your own if you have other thoughts!

### What is the structure of your dataset?

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?


# Bivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what relationships
between variables might be interesting to look at in this section? Don't limit
yourself to relationships between a main output feature and one of the
supporting variables. Try to look at relationships between supporting variables
as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

```

# Bivariate Analysis

> **Tip**: As before, summarize what you found in your bivariate explorations
here. Use the questions below to guide your discussion.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?


# Multivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what you found in
the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate plots to investigate
more complex interactions between variables. Make sure that the plots that you
create here are justified by the plots you explored in the previous section. If
you plan on creating any mathematical models, this is the section where you
will do that.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \
strengths and limitations of your model.

# Final Plots and Summary

> **Tip**: You've done a lot of exploration and have built up an understanding
of the structure of and relationships between the variables in your dataset.
Here, you will select three plots from all of your previous exploration to
present here as a summary of some of your most interesting findings. Make sure
that you have refined your selected plots for good titling, axis labels (with
units), and good aesthetic choices (e.g. color, transparency). After each plot,
make sure you justify why you chose each plot by describing what it shows.

### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}

```

### Description One


### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}

```

### Description Two


### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}

```

### Description Three

# Reflection

> **Tip**: Here's the final step! Reflect on the exploration you performed and
the insights you found. What were some of the struggles that you went through?
What went well? What was surprising? Make sure you include an insight into
future work that could be done with the dataset.

> **Tip**: Don't forget to remove this, and the other **Tip** sections before
saving your final work and knitting the final report!
